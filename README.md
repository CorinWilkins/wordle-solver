# Wordle Solver
## Getting started:

Run:
- `poetry install` to install dependencies.
- `poetry run main` to start the solver. (this takes ~10s to warm up)
- You will then be prompeted to enter each guess followed by the colours of the letters. eg: `00112`
    - `2` for green
    - `1` for yellow
    - `0` for black

## Tests

To run tests run `poetry run ptw`
